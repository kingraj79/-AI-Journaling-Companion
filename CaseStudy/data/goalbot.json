      "answer": "Nice work hitting legs twice in two days! It looks like you're getting into a rhythm with your workouts and might be considering targeting different muscle groups each day, which is a great way to keep things interesting and avoid plateaus.\n\nTomorrow, consider arriving at the gym by 6:30 AM so you can get a good hour of weightlifting in before the crowds pick up.",
